The project topic that we were given is to create a mobile app that allows users to order food. The idea that we plan to implement is given a list of restaurants you will pick one restaurant. After picking you restaurant you will be given the restaurants menu and all the food items they have available. However, It wont just show you the menu but will display items one by one. If you like the item you swipe right to add it to you cart and swipe left to keep searching for different items. Overall, This is our app concept that we will work on through out the quarter.
